# Java_Object-Oriented-Complex-Number-_-_Matrix-Vector-Product



1. Complex Numbers (Object-Oriented)


      Implementation the complex number class in an object-oriented way. This means, each class methods that has at least one parameter must be transformed into an instance
      method.
      
      
2. Matrix-vector product


      a) a method dot(VectorD) to compute the Euclidean inner product,
      b) a method norm() for obtaining the Euclidean norm.
      c) evaluation of the matrix-vector product mul(VectorD). The method gets a vector product of the matrix with this vector as type VectorD.
